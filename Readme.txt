Weather dashboard represents a application to look up current weather and 5 day weather forecast. User may type in a search area city name where he or she would like to see weather forecast. Weather forcast is updated every few hours dynamically. All previous searches are saved on the left side of the screen.  

To get this application to work we had to use multiple weather API.
